        Welcome to the help page for <span>Join</span>, your guide to using
        our kanban project management tool. Here, we'll provide an overview fo
        what <span>Join</span> is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.
      </p>
      <h2>What is Join?</h2>
      <p>
        <span>Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed
        and built by a group of dedicated students as part of their web
        development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective
        method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize
        efficiency (or flow). <span>Join</span> leverages the principles of
        kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive,
        visual interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important to note that <span>Join</span> is designed as an
        educational exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage.
        While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot
        guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other
        aspects of quality regarding Join.

      <h2>How to use it</h2>
      <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span>Join</span></p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <div>
            <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
            <p>
              When you log in to <span>Join</span>, you'll find a default
              board. This board represents your project and contains four
              default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and
              "Done".
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
            <p>
              In <span>Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on
              your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New
              contact", and fill in the required information. Once added,
              these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with
              the tasks on the board.
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
            <p>
              Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards.
              Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the
              appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details
              in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees,
              etc.
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <h3>Moving Cards</h3>
            <p>
              As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect
              that on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one
              list to another.
            </p>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div>
            <h3>Deleting Cards</h3>
            <p>
              Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done"
              list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it
              from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as
              this action is irreversible. Remember that using
              <span>Join</span> effectively requires consistent updates from
              you and your team to ensure the board reflects the current state
              of your project. Have more questions about <span>Join</span>?
